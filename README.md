# Employee Management Fullstack

This is a **Fullstack Employee Management System** built with love ❤️ in just **18 hours**.  
The project contains:

- **Backend** → Node.js, Express.js with MySQL Database.  
- **Frontend** → React.js .
- 
## project Description

I wanted to create something simple yet powerful –  
A system where employees can be added, viewed, updated, and deleted easily.  
So I started from scratch:

- Designed the **backend APIs** in Express with MySQL integration.  
- Built the **frontend** in React with clean UI and **GSAP animations** to make it lively.  
- Connected both sides → and boom 💥 the system came alive!
